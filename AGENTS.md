# Project Guidelines

Project-specific conventions, on top of the Boost guidelines above.

## Editing these guidelines

This whole `<laravel-boost-guidelines>` block is **generated** — do not hand-edit
`CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` (they'd drift apart and your change is overwritten on
the next regen). Single source of truth: `.ai/guidelines/*.md`. To change project
conventions, edit `.ai/guidelines/project.md`, then run `php artisan boost:install
--guidelines` to rewrite the block into every agent file identically.

## Architecture: Domain-Driven Design

Business logic organized by **domain**, not technical type. All domain code
shares one namespace root `App\Domains\*` under `app/` — so Rector, Shift, IDE
tooling, and Laravel auto-discovery work with no `composer.json` autoload
changes.

### Backend layout

```
app/Domains/
├── Common/              # shared kernel — used by many domains

│   ├── Contracts/       # interfaces other domains depend on

│   ├── ValueObjects/
│   ├── Enums/
│   └── Data/            # DTOs

└── {Domain}/            # e.g. Catalog, Billing — one bounded context

    ├── Models/
    ├── Actions/         # see Action classes below

    ├── Contracts/       # the ONLY cross-domain entry point

    └── ...              # add default Laravel folders as needed

```

- Plural `Domains`, one folder per bounded context.
- Folders use default Laravel names (`Models`, `Actions`, `Services`, `Events`,
  `Jobs`, `Policies`, `Enums`, `Exceptions`, `Data`, …). Create a subfolder only
  when you have something to put in it — no empty scaffolding.
- Non-domain infra/UI (`app/Http`, `app/Filament`, `app/Providers`) stays at
  `app/` root and *calls into* domains.

### Action classes

Single-purpose actions live in `App\Domains\{Domain}\Actions`.

- Name `VerbNoun` in PascalCase, **no `Action` suffix**; noun includes the entity
  so it reads clearly when imported — `CreateUser`, `UpdateUserProfile`,
  `ResetUserPassword` (not `Create`, `UpdateProfile`).
- Standalone actions expose one `handle()` method. Actions bound to a framework
  contract (e.g. Fortify `CreatesNewUsers`) keep the interface's method name
  (`create`/`update`/`reset`).
- Example: Fortify auth/profile actions live in `App\Domains\Identity\Actions`,
  wired in `App\Providers\FortifyServiceProvider` (app root, infra).

### Exceptions

Always use **explicitly named exception classes** — one class per distinct
failure, named for the failure it represents. Never funnel multiple unrelated
failures through a single catch-all exception (with static factory methods or a
type/code discriminator) — split it into named classes so callers can `catch`
each case by type.

- Name for the condition, PascalCase, in `App\Domains\{Domain}\Exceptions` —
  e.g. `CorruptImdbDatasetArchive`, `CannotOpenImdbDatasetArchive`.
- A static named constructor (`::at($path)`) for message construction is fine;
  one-failure-per-class is the rule, not the factory style.

### Enums

Logic that operates over an enum's **own cases** — validating, parsing, or
normalizing raw values against the case set — lives as **static methods on the
enum**, not in a trait, helper, or action. Keep it next to the cases it checks.

- e.g. `Genre::knownValues(array $raw): array` filters raw IMDb strings to
  recognized backing values, dropping unknown ones.
- Don't reach for a shared `Concerns/` trait just because two actions need it —
  a static enum method shares just as well and keeps the knowledge on the type.

### Cross-domain rules

- A domain never imports another domain's `Models` or internals — only its
  `Contracts/` (interfaces) or published `Services`.
- `Common` is the shared kernel: only *incredibly stable* shared concepts (value
  objects, enums, contracts, DTOs). Keep it small — bloat couples every domain.
- `Common` depends on nothing domain-specific.

### Frontend layout (Inertia + React)

Mirrors backend domains (Inertia owns `pages/`, so it can't live under a PHP
namespace). Rule: *"Does it relate to a business domain/feature?"*

```
resources/js/
├── common/            # generic, reusable, no domain knowledge (mirrors Domains\Common)

├── modules/{domain}/  # reusable domain UI/logic across pages (mirrors Domains\{Domain})

└── pages/             # Inertia entry points by URL; page-local components only

```

- `pages/{x}/components/` = that page only. Shared domain UI → `modules/`.
- PascalCase components, camelCase other files, kebab-case dirs, `Page`/`Layout`
  suffixes.

### Testing (DDD + TDD)

**Test-first by default.** Build features via the `tdd` skill
(`.claude/skills/tdd`): RED → GREEN → REFACTOR, one behavior **slice** (a cohesive
set of ~2–6 tests) per cycle, each phase run by an **isolated subagent** so tests
can't be retrofitted to the code. The RED slice is presented for approval via
Conductor's plan UI before any code is written.

- **Every test follows Arrange–Act–Assert (AAA).** No exceptions, backend or
  frontend: three blocks in order — set up state, perform **one** action, assert
  the outcome — separated by a blank line. One Act per test; need a second action,
  write a second test. Keep Arrange minimal (factories/props only).
- **Test behavior through public interfaces, not implementation** — tests must
  survive refactoring. A slice = one coherent behavior plus its obvious variants.
- **Tests mirror the domain tree.** Backend tests live under
  `tests/Feature/{Domain}/` (and `tests/Unit/{Domain}/`), mirroring
  `app/Domains/{Domain}/` — the same way the frontend mirrors domains via
  `resources/js/modules/{domain}/`.
- **API / external-HTTP tests use real-data fixtures in the API's native wire
  format.** Capture a small real response slice, commit it under
  `tests/Fixtures/{Domain}/{source}/` (domained, sub-keyed by external source) in
  the exact format + extension the API returns (`.tsv.gz`, `.json`, …) — the
  fixture is a **byte-exact copy** of the source response, no transform. Load it
  into `Http::fake()` via `fixtureBytes('Catalog/imdb/title.basics.tsv.gz')`
  (reads the bytes; Pest's built-in `fixture()` resolves the path). Never
  fabricate response bodies by hand. `Http::preventStrayRequests()` is on
  globally for Feature tests (`tests/Pest.php`), so every external call must be
  faked or the test fails. (DB *state* still uses factories, never fixtures —
  response-body fixtures are a different thing. Synthetic bodies are allowed only
  for inputs that can't exist in real data: malformed/corrupt payloads, blank
  lines, HTTP error responses.)
- **Backend:** Pest 4 — `php artisan test --compact` (filter `--filter=name`).
  Feature tests are the default (`tests/Feature`); unit tests only for isolated
  logic (`tests/Unit`). Use factories + `RefreshDatabase`; assert Inertia props
  with `AssertableInertia`. Create tests via `php artisan make:test --pest`.
- **Frontend:** Vitest + React Testing Library — `npm test`. Colocate a
  `*.test.tsx` sibling; query by role/text; mock `@inertiajs/react`; jsdom env,
  setup at `resources/js/test/setup.ts`.
- **Full-stack Inertia feature** → two cycles, **backend first** (Feature test
  asserts the Inertia component + props), then frontend (RTL renders the page with
  those props).
- Detailed conventions live in the `.claude/skills/laravel-testing` and
  `.claude/skills/react-testing` skills (referenced, not duplicated here).

Domain boundaries are enforced by **Pest architecture tests**, not code review (a
domain's `Models` used only within that domain; `Common` depends on no concrete
domain). The arch-test suite itself lands in a separate PR.

### File creation

Always create files with `php artisan make:*` commands when one exists (models,
migrations, policies, tests, classes via `make:class`, etc.) — don't hand-write
boilerplate. Make it land in the DDD structure: pass the domain path in the
name, e.g. `php artisan make:model Domains/Catalog/Models/Product` →
`app/Domains/Catalog/Models/Product.php`, namespace
`App\Domains\Catalog\Models`. If a generator can't target the domain path,
generate then move the file and fix its namespace. Never break the DDD layout
to satisfy a generator's default location.

## Configuration

- **Base URLs for third-party data sources are service constants, not env or
  config.** A public, fixed endpoint (e.g. the IMDb datasets host
  `https://datasets.imdbws.com`) is not a secret and does not vary by
  environment — commit it as a `private const` on the service that calls it, so
  the value sits next to the code that uses it. Reserve `config`/`env` for
  secrets, credentials, and values that genuinely differ per environment.
- **Only *required* env vars belong in `.env.example`.** An env var the app
  needs to run (a secret/credential with no safe default — e.g. an API token)
  goes in `.env.example`. An *optional* tunable that reads through `env()` with a
  sensible default in `config/` (e.g. a concurrency cap or retry delay) stays out
  of `.env.example` — its default IS the documentation. Don't pad the example
  file with every knob; a fresh clone should see only the keys it must fill in.

## Documentation

- **Keep the README in sync.** When a change touches anything `README.md`
  documents (setup, commands, env vars, architecture, dependencies, structure),
  prompt the user to update it and name the stale section. Never silently edit
  the README; never let it drift.
- **A new required env var → update the README install steps.** When work adds an
  env var the app needs to run (e.g. a third-party API key/token), add it to the
  README "Required API keys" table in *Getting Started* so a fresh install has
  every key defined — var name, what it's required for, and where to obtain it.
  Don't leave a key documented only in `.env.example`.
- **Grow the Overview and Screenshots as features ship.** The README `Overview`
  and `Screenshots` sections start as TODO placeholders. When a user-facing
  feature lands, prompt the user to extend the Overview to describe it and to add
  a screenshot/demo of it. Remove the TODO marker once the section has real
  content.

## Linear (Issue Tracking)

All work tracked in **Linear** via the `mcp__linear-server__*` MCP (Conductor
provides detailed usage separately).

- **Always use the Linear MCP tools** for every lookup/create/update — never
  assume or hand-edit ticket state.
- **Every branch maps to ≥1 ticket**, and the branch name includes every ticket
  id it addresses. Use Linear's branch name but drop the user prefix
  (`jasonlund/`) and shorten to ≤40 chars — e.g. `flix-123-scaffold-new-app`.
- **No ticket yet → prompt to create one** (via Linear MCP) from the work at
  hand. Don't proceed ticketless.
- **Work deviates → update the ticket, confirm first.** If implementation
  diverges from the ticket, prompt the user to confirm, then update the ticket
  and mark it clearly as a deviation.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia client-side patterns.

# Inertia v3

- Use all Inertia features from v1, v2, and v3. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New v3 features: standalone HTTP requests (`useHttp` hook), optimistic updates with automatic rollback, layout props (`useLayoutProps` hook), instant visits, simplified SSR via `@inertiajs/vite` plugin, custom exception handling for error pages.
- Carried over from v2: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.
- Axios has been removed. Use the built-in XHR client with interceptors, or install Axios separately if needed.
- `Inertia::lazy()` / `LazyProp` has been removed. Use `Inertia::optional()` instead.
- Prop types (`Inertia::optional()`, `Inertia::defer()`, `Inertia::merge()`) work inside nested arrays with dot-notation paths.
- SSR works automatically in Vite dev mode with `@inertiajs/vite` - no separate Node.js server needed during development.
- Event renames: `invalid` is now `httpException`, `exception` is now `networkError`.
- `router.cancel()` replaced by `router.cancelAll()`.
- The `future` configuration namespace has been removed - all v2 future options are now always enabled.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== inertia-react/core rules ===

# Inertia + React

- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia React client-side patterns.
